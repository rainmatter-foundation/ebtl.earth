				<h1>About US</h1>
				<p>EBTL is designed and managed by a ground team that lives on site with the support of Rainmatter foundation.  Our primary focus in the initial three years were developing a native tree nursery and also understanding the land with respect to water flows during monsoons. We have also intervened with mix of strategies like active tree planting, removal of invasives and natural regeneration of land. For this we have also collaborated with a few practitioners whose names are mentioned below.</p>

			<p>Post realising the lack of interest in my engineering degree, I spent many years travelling and volunteering in animal shelters and wildlife rescue centres. The diversity in the natural world has always fascinated me, how should one comprehend the many ways in which the same world is perceived by different life forms? And how as a species we find our position in this intricate web of beings. Living and working in EBTL gives me a unique opportunity to be a student of the natural world and pursue my different passions- art, farming, wildlife, forests and many more interests yet to be discovered.</p>`

			<p>For a few years now have been working on restoration in degraded land areas. Have been  documenting flora, understanding past human  landscape interactions, raising native plant nurseries and doing planting.</p>
			<p>This has been in Eastern Ghats hill ranges of Krishnagiri and more recently in the aslo in the  Nilgiris in abandoned coffee estates. At EBTL, I lead the seed collection work and established the nursery. I also took care of the planting work and managing the restoration site. Currently I focus on carrying out Monitoring and evaluation of restored sites at EBTL.</p>`

			<p>The network of interconnectedness within nature has always surprised me. In 2021, I did a 3 month horticulture course in Auroville botanical gardens after which I volunteered with The Forestway in Thiruvanamalai. I have spent a lot of time exploring the dry deciduous forests of the south Deccan plateau, and being a part of the EBTL on ground team enables me to explore even further. Currently I manage the native flora nursery in EBTL and also work the citizen science programmes. I look forward to going more into the forests around, teaching myself about the life in them and in the process contribute to the restoration work on ground.</p>`

			<p>I am a professional wildlife photographer, photography mentor and naturalist. After an engineering degree and an MBA, I worked in the corporate world briefly before I realised my passion for wildlife and photography. I have travelled to wildlife habitats around the world, including rainforests, polar regions, high altitude Himalayas, deserts and islands. I build photography narratives that weave in creative perspectives along with natural history and conservation principles. I have published my stories in diverse print and digital magazines such as National Geographic Traveller, Sanctuary Asia, Saevus, Lonely Planet India, Round Glass Sustain, Nature inFocus and JLR Explore.</p>
			<p>I mentors enthusiastic photographers on wildlife photography tours across the world.As a naturalist, I have trained and certified naturalists across Karnataka in association with Jungle Lodges and Resorts and Karnataka Eco-tourism Development Board. I was also part of a team that described 2 new species of geckos from the dry regions of Karnataka.</p>
			<p>At EBTL, I am documenting and photographing wildlife across the campus and surrounding areas to gain a better understanding of the wildlife in the region and the impact of restoration initiatives in enhancing their habitat.</p>`
